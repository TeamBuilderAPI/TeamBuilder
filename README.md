Welcome to Team Builder! 

These ideas came to me shortly after college, (a tech school), when I desired to have a stable Team ready for new game releases and or sports where pickup games just were not promising on a routine attendance. I also desired a way to have a full team for an extended or routine amount of time. I desired to fill in empty positions without missing the new game release, push for a world-first achievement, or sporting events, where a full team was needed for a satisfying accurate game. Quick and reliable plug and play for empty spots was key when trying to have a full game experience. 

This Team Builder app applies to more than just Sports and games, it could essentially be anything, examples such as a DND or a Magic Card tournament, the list goes on with imagination as key to the heart of its design! 

Overall Goals:
This idea does not claim to need anything other than 'free contribution' until the Patent/Trademark etc. can be legally funded. Considering this the free market for now, and encourage all to participate. 

About me:
I have been simply an inventor minded person since childhood. I also love software engineering and using the latest technology. I also love to make something that is highly needed, that currently is a challenge (or save man hours through automation), designed and built into a smooth automated process to produce success for those around the World, and even for my own success. All ideas are encouraged!

Best Regards,
