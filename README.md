# TeamBuilder

Welcome to Team Builder! These ideas came to me shortly after college (a tech school) when I desired to have a stable team ready for new game releases and or sports where pickup games just were not promising on a routine attendance, I desired a way to have a full team for an extended or routine amount of time. I also desired to fill in empty positions without missing the new game release, push for a world fist achievement or sporting events where a full team was needed for a satisfying accurate game. Plug and play for empty spots was key when trying to have a full game experience. This app applys to more than just sports and games, it could essentially be anything such as a DND or magic card tournament, the list goes on with imagination as key to the heart of its design! This idea does not claim to need anything other than free contribution until the Patent/Trademark etc can be legally funded. Considering this the free market, and encourage all to participate. I am simply an inventor mindset person since childhood. I also love software engineering and using the latest technology. I also love to make something that is highly needed, that currently is a challenge into a smooth automated process to output success for myself and those around the World. All ideas are encouraged!
